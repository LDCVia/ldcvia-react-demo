# ldcvia-react-demo
A simple React and jQuery application with LDC Via as a back end

To see a demo go to (https://ldcvia.s3.amazonaws.com/ldcvia-react-demo/index.html)[https://ldcvia.s3.amazonaws.com/ldcvia-react-demo/index.html]

In the demo, you can see that the app requires the user to log in, a session cookie is generated by LDC Via and returned to the user. From there they can get a list of all of the first 30 people in the database (there are 200,000 people in the database in total). They can add new people, edit existing people or delete existing people.

All of this is controlled with a single HTML file (index.html) and a single JavaScript file (app.js)
